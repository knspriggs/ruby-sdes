This is a basic implemetation of S-DES in ruby. It was created as part of an assignment, but I thought it was pretty cool code.

It still requires some work to modulize(?) it, so that if anyone ever wanted to, they could use it for things and such.

After I modulize(?) it I will write some tests as well to ensure that it all runs smoothly when any changes in the future.
